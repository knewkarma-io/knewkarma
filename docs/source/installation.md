# Installation

Get started with Knew Karma through the simple installation process, whether you prefer using a CLI, Python library,
or Docker. Follow these steps to get up and running.

## PyPI Package

You'll need to have Python 3.10 or later installed on your system in order to install Knew Karma from PyPI.

You can install it by running the following command:

```shell
pip install knewkarma[core]
```

The installation command structure will vary based on the current shell, so if the above command fails, you can try
running:

```shell
pip install knewkarma\[core\]
```

or

```shell
pip install "knewkarma[core]"

```

## Snap Package

If you prefer installing Knew Karma from the Snap Store instead, you can either run

```shell
snap install knewkarma
```

Or, open the Snap Store desktop app (assuming snap is already installed), and search for "Knew Karma", then proceed to
install the
package.

## Docker Image

If you prefer a containerised variant of Knew Karma, you can pull the official image from dockerhub by running:

```shell
docker pull rly0nheart/knewkarma
```
