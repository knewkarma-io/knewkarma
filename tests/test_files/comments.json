Let's say you had an evacuation and headed to the escape pod, you separate and are no longer spinning at 26 rpm. Instead you are traveling in a straight line at zero gravity (although you could \"spin up\" the ship over time) Seems to me that would be just as bad as instantly spinning up to 26 rpm... \n\nThis would be one of the limitations on using spin gravity on a maneuvering spaceship, you would be introducing variable felt gravity, and even worse, variable rotation.

Let&amp;#39;s say you had an evacuation and headed to the escape pod, you separate and are no longer spinning at 26 rpm. Instead you are traveling in a straight line at zero gravity (although you could &amp;quot;spin up&amp;quot; the ship over time) Seems to me that would be just as bad as instantly spinning up to 26 rpm... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would be one of the limitations on using spin gravity on a maneuvering spaceship, you would be introducing variable felt gravity, and even worse, variable rotation. This is assuming the engineering is even allowing maneuver due to gyroscopic effects&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Throw it more forward in the direction of rotation and itll go 'down' faster, throw it against the direction of rotation and you might just reach escape velocity making the ball get 'stuck' in mid air somewhere so you can catch it the next time you rotate past it.

During that one second, you and the station have rotated 50 feet forward, but the object will land another 28.5 feet forward (spinward) from where you were standing. Likewise, if you just dropped something from shoulder height, it would land a few inches behind the drop point (antispinward). The opposite effect happens when you drop something down the shaft of a tall tower on Earth; it lands very slightly eastward of straight down.\n\nTo answer the second part of your question, there isn't any force that pushes it back down, outward against the ring. It's just that moving in a straight line will inevitably hit the ring somewhere. The floor of the ring itself is being pulled up, inward toward the thrown object.",

During that one second, you and the station have rotated 50 feet forward, but the object will land another 28.5 feet forward (spinward) from where you were standing. Likewise, if you just dropped something from shoulder height, it would land a few inches behind the drop point (antispinward). The opposite effect happens when you drop something down the shaft of a tall tower on Earth; it lands very slightly eastward of straight down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer the second part of your question, there isn&amp;#39;t any force that pushes it back down, outward against the ring. It&amp;#39;s just that moving in a straight line will inevitably hit the ring somewhere. The floor of the ring itself is being pulled up, inward toward the thrown object.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The length of that chord is dependent on the direction you throw the ball and how hard. \n\nLet's say that you throw the ball straight \"up\" at a velocity equal to your radial velocity. The astronaut will see the ball follow a path 45\u00b0 internal to the circle and see it hit the \"ground\" at a point 90\u00b0 further round the circle than you released it. With a velocity of  sqrt(2) times your radial velocity.\n\nThe length of that chord is given by the formula 2 x r x sin(theta/2) where theta is the angle that the chord subtends at the centre.\n\nIn the specific instance mentioned above, this works out to be \u221a2r. Ooh look, two square roots of 2! This could be useful.\n\nIn the meantime, you will be traveling around the circumference, a longer distance at a slower velocity. The length of the arc is given by the formula 2\u03c0r x (theta\u00b0/360), so plugging in the numbers we get 0.5 x \u03c0 x r, or approximately 1.57 r.\n\nSo if we let *t* be the time it takes the ball to travel across the chord and hit the \"ground* again, how far would you have travelled? Well, you'd have travelled 2/\u03c0 of the distance or roughly two-thirds of the distance. So, from your perspective the ball would go up and come down again, landing roughly an eighth of the way round the circle ahead of you.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the ball, if thrown straight up will *always* land ahead of you, since the chord of a circle is always shorter than the matching arc, and the ball will *always* be travelling faster than you because it has its initial velocity (the same as yours) plus whatever velocity you impart to it when you throw it straight up.\n\nThe limit of this case is if you throw it straight up fast enough to ignore the radial velocity (infinite speed!) component, where it will land directly opposite you.\n\nNow, the fun stuff happens when you throw at an angle other than straight up. The ball will always follow a straight line (chord) with respect to a non-rotating external frame of reference, except in the case where you throw it tangentially backwards at exactly the same speed as you are going forwards where, ignoring air resistance inside the space station, the ball will appear to the observer to be stationary.\n\nFor you, in this scenario, the ball will appear to orbit at the height you threw it, neither rising nor falling until some time later - as you gaze into the distance to see where it landed behind you - it smacks you in the back of the head.",
